## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you don't, you can download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Download the project files for the Netflix recommendation system from the project's GitHub repository (https://github.com/Kinjuriu/my_recommendation_system).

Extract the downloaded files to a directory on your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the project files.

Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the following command to start the recommendation system:
python main.py


## Usage

Start the recommendation system by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:
python main.py

When the recommendation system starts up, it will prompt you to enter a UserID or a movieID. Try entering a UserId or movieID that you like, and press Enter to search for it. 

The recommendation system will search its database for the UserId or movieID you entered, and if it is found, it will generate a list of similar titles. It will also be processed into a csv file.

If you want to search for a different movie or TV show, you can enter a new title and press Enter to search for it. The recommendation system will generate a new list of recommendations based on your new search.

If you want to quit the recommendation system, you can press the Q key on your keyboard to exit.
